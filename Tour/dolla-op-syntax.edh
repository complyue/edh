# Note:

# - `$` is the low-precedence procedure call operator,

# - curly brackets quoting is not necessary for a single statement, but nice to
#   have, for future sibling statements to be added


# this may be the most idiomatic form, it may help a bit if you build the
# intuition that those 2 `$` are quoting the condition, or if any of the `$`
# omitted, that's different semantic
